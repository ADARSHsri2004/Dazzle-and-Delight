# Dazzle-and-Delight

The project creates an event management website that provides a platform for the users to view information about the events that took place in the past and the ones that are about to take place shortly.

The application enables the user to view and book an ongoing or upcoming event in a particular locality. Users should register themselves to log into the account for online booking of tickets. The users can be administrators, event organizers, and customers. They can first log into the website and see through theinformation such as details about the events. The administrator can log in and update the information, delete any unwanted data, and arrangethe information accordingly. The event organizer is the one who organizes events; they will upload event details. Customers can view events and they can book events. Customers can view or send feedback on particular events. 

Event Management System (Dazzle and Delight) is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
